# Price Prediction Game  "Oh My Balls"

## 1. Executive Summary

The Price Prediction Game represents a sophisticated demonstration platform designed to showcase the technical superiority of a custom asynchronous Python library over traditional synchronous approaches in the context of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. This interactive multiplayer game serves as both an engaging audience participation tool and a compelling technical demonstration for hackathon presentations, particularly targeting the Hyperliquid ecosystem.

**Project Vision and Objectives**

The primary objective of this project is to create a live, interactive demonstration that can accommodate up to 20 participants simultaneously in a 30-second gaming session. The game leverages cutting-edge blockchain technology, real-time price feeds, and asynchronous programming paradigms to deliver a seamless user experience while highlighting the performance advantages of custom-built asynchronous libraries over their synchronous counterparts.

The demonstration serves multiple strategic purposes within the broader context of DeFi development and blockchain innovation. First, it provides a tangible, real-world application that showcases the practical benefits of asynchronous programming in high-frequency trading environments. Second, it demonstrates the integration capabilities between multiple blockchain services, including HyperEVM for smart contract execution, HyperCore for real-time market data, and the custom Hyper Async Library for parallel order processing. Third, it creates an engaging, memorable experience for hackathon audiences, combining technical sophistication with interactive entertainment.

**Technical Innovation and Differentiation**

The core technical innovation lies in the implementation of parallel order execution using the custom Hyper Async Library. Traditional synchronous approaches would require sequential processing of 20 individual orders, creating significant latency and potential bottlenecks in high-frequency trading scenarios. The asynchronous implementation enables simultaneous processing of all orders, dramatically reducing execution time and demonstrating the scalability advantages of properly implemented concurrent programming.

The architecture integrates three distinct blockchain services seamlessly through a Python-based backend system. HyperEVM provides the smart contract layer for fair ball assignment and game state management, utilizing on-chain randomness to ensure transparent and verifiable game mechanics. HyperCore delivers real-time BTC-USD price feeds with sub-second latency, enabling responsive visual updates and accurate game resolution. The Hyper Async Library orchestrates complex multi-order scenarios that would be impractical or impossible with synchronous implementations.

**Game Mechanics and User Experience**

The game mechanics are designed to be immediately accessible to hackathon audiences while demonstrating sophisticated technical concepts. Participants join the game by scanning a QR code that connects their mobile wallets to the game interface. Each participant receives a randomly assigned "ball" representing either a long or short position on Bitcoin price movements. The assignment process utilizes on-chain randomness through the HyperEVM smart contract, ensuring fairness and transparency.

During the 30-second gameplay period, participants observe real-time price movements displayed on a shared screen, with visual indicators showing which positions are currently winning based on price direction. The game concludes with the execution of 20 simultaneous limit orders through the Hyper Async Library, with only the winning position (closest to the final price movement) receiving execution confirmation. This mechanism demonstrates both the technical capabilities of parallel order processing and the practical applications of asynchronous programming in trading scenarios.

**Target Audience and Success Metrics**

The primary target audience consists of blockchain developers, DeFi enthusiasts, and hackathon participants with technical backgrounds in distributed systems, trading algorithms, or cryptocurrency development. The demonstration is specifically designed to resonate with individuals who understand the technical challenges of building high-performance trading systems and can appreciate the engineering solutions presented.

Success metrics for the demonstration include technical performance indicators such as sub-100ms response times for price updates, successful execution of all 20 orders within a 2-second window, and zero system failures during the 30-second game duration. User engagement metrics focus on participation rates, with the goal of achieving full 20-participant capacity within 60 seconds of QR code display, and positive audience feedback regarding both the entertainment value and technical sophistication of the demonstration.

**Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies**

The project implementation acknowledges several potential risk factors and incorporates comprehensive mitigation strategies. Network latency represents the primary technical risk, as the demonstration relies on real-time data feeds and blockchain interactions. Mitigation strategies include local testing environments, fallback data sources, and graceful degradation mechanisms that maintain functionality even under adverse network conditions.

Smart contract risks are minimized through the use of testnet deployments exclusively, ensuring that no real financial value is at stake during demonstrations. The game mechanics are designed to be entertaining and educational rather than financially consequential, with physical rewards (such as cookies) replacing monetary incentives.

User experience risks, including wallet connection failures or mobile device compatibility issues, are addressed through comprehensive testing across multiple device types and wallet implementations. The QR code connection mechanism provides a low-friction entry point that works across diverse mobile platforms and wallet applications.

**Development Timeline and Resource Requirements**

The project is structured as a rapid development initiative suitable for hackathon timelines, with an estimated development period of 10-14 days for a fully functional minimum viable product (MVP). The development process is organized into four distinct phases: core logic and smart contract development, visualization and real-time gameplay implementation, asynchronous library integration and order execution, and comprehensive testing with polish.

Resource requirements include a development team with expertise in Python backend development, blockchain smart contract programming, frontend web development, and real-time systems architecture. The technical stack leverages existing open-source frameworks and libraries to minimize development overhead while maintaining professional-grade code quality and system reliability.

**Strategic Impact and Future Applications**

Beyond its immediate application as a hackathon demonstration tool, the Price Prediction Game serves as a proof-of-concept for broader applications in DeFi infrastructure development. The architectural patterns and technical solutions developed for this project can be adapted for production trading systems, market-making algorithms, and other high-frequency financial applications where asynchronous processing provides competitive advantages.

The project also establishes a foundation for future educational initiatives and developer onboarding programs within the Hyperliquid ecosystem.

## 3. Technical Architecture and Implementation Breakdown

### 3.1 High-Level Components

### 3.2 Tech Stack by Component (Python Backend Focus)

The technical architecture has been redesigned to leverage Python as the primary backend technology, taking advantage of the existing Python-based Hyper Async Library. This approach ensures seamless integration with the custom asynchronous library while maintaining high performance for real-time operations.

#### Backend Architecture (Python-Based)

**Core Framework: Flask with AsyncIO Integration**

The backend utilizes Flask as the primary web framework, enhanced with asyncio capabilities for handling asynchronous operations. Flask provides the necessary HTTP endpoints for the web application while asyncio manages concurrent operations such as price polling, order execution, and WebSocket communications.

```python
# Core Flask application structure
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_socketio import SocketIO, emit
import asyncio
import threading
from hyper_async_lib import HyperAsyncClient

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key'
socketio = SocketIO(app, cors_allowed_origins="*")
```

**Asynchronous Operations Management**

The Python backend implements a dedicated async event loop running in a separate thread to handle all asynchronous operations without blocking the main Flask application thread. This design pattern ensures that the web interface remains responsive while background tasks execute concurrently.

**Database Layer: SQLite with SQLAlchemy**

For development and demonstration purposes, the application uses SQLite as the database backend with SQLAlchemy ORM for data modeling. This choice provides simplicity for deployment while maintaining the flexibility to upgrade to PostgreSQL or other databases for production use.

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///game.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class Player(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    wallet_address = db.Column(db.String(42), unique=True, nullable=False)
    ball_assignment = db.Column(db.String(10), nullable=False)
    position_type = db.Column(db.String(5), nullable=False)  # 'long' or 'short'
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
```

#### Integration Components

**HyperEVM Smart Contract Interface**

The Python backend interfaces with HyperEVM smart contracts using Web3.py, providing a robust connection to the blockchain layer for player registration, ball assignments, and game state management.

```python
from web3 import Web3
from web3.middleware import geth_poa_middleware

class HyperEVMInterface:
    def __init__(self, contract_address, abi, private_key):
        self.w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://testnet.hyperliquid.xyz'))
        self.w3.middleware_onion.inject(geth_poa_middleware, layer=0)
        self.contract = self.w3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=abi)
        self.account = self.w3.eth.account.from_key(private_key)
    
    async def assign_ball(self, player_address):
        # Implement ball assignment logic
        pass
```

**Hyper Async Library Integration**

The custom Hyper Async Library serves as the cornerstone of the backend architecture, enabling parallel execution of multiple operations that would otherwise require sequential processing with the official synchronous library.

```python
from hyper_async_lib import HyperAsyncClient, OrderBatch

class GameOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hyper_client = HyperAsyncClient(
            api_key=os.getenv('HYPERLIQUID_API_KEY'),
            secret=os.getenv('HYPERLIQUID_SECRET')
        )
    
    async def execute_batch_orders(self, orders):
        # Demonstrate async advantage: 20 orders in parallel
        batch = OrderBatch(orders)
        results = await self.hyper_client.execute_batch(batch)
        return results
```

**Real-Time Price Feed Management**

The HyperCore integration handles real-time BTC-USD price feeds through WebSocket connections, with automatic reconnection and error handling mechanisms built into the Python backend.

```python
import websockets
import json

class PriceFeedManager:
    def __init__(self, socketio_instance):
        self.socketio = socketio_instance
        self.current_price = None
        self.price_history = []
    
    async def connect_to_hypercore(self):
        uri = "wss://api.hyperliquid.xyz/ws"
        async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
            subscribe_msg = {
                "method": "subscribe",
                "subscription": {"type": "allMids"}
            }
            await websocket.send(json.dumps(subscribe_msg))
            
            async for message in websocket:
                data = json.loads(message)
                if 'BTC' in data:
                    await self.process_price_update(data['BTC'])
```

The game rules and mechanics are carefully designed to balance simplicity for immediate participant understanding with technical sophistication that demonstrates advanced blockchain and asynchronous programming concepts. The rule set ensures fair play through transparent, verifiable processes while maintaining engagement through real-time visual feedback and competitive elements.

**Participant Registration and Ball Assignment**

The game begins with a streamlined participant registration phase that prioritizes speed and simplicity for demonstration purposes. Participants scan a displayed QR code using their mobile devices, which automatically opens a web-based game interface. The interface requires no wallet connections or cryptocurrency setup, allowing participants to join immediately by simply entering a display name or remaining anonymous.

Upon accessing the game interface, each participant is automatically registered in the game system and assigned a unique session identifier. The backend system manages all blockchain interactions through pre-configured team wallets, eliminating the complexity of individual wallet management while maintaining the technical demonstration of blockchain integration.

The ball assignment system distributes 20 unique positions among participants: 10 "Long" balls (designated B0 through B9) and 10 "Short" balls (designated S0 through S9). Long balls represent bullish positions that profit from Bitcoin price increases, while Short balls represent bearish positions that profit from price decreases. Each ball is associated with a specific price level offset from the starting price, creating a structured grid of potential winning positions.

The assignment process utilizes server-side randomization algorithms that ensure fair distribution while maintaining the demonstration's focus on asynchronous processing capabilities. The HyperEVM smart contract handles ball assignments through the team's managed wallets, with all blockchain interactions abstracted away from individual participants. This approach maintains the technical sophistication of the demonstration while providing a frictionless user experience that maximizes participation rates during live presentations.

**Game Initialization and Price Anchoring**

Once 20 participants have successfully registered and received ball assignments, the game enters the initialization phase. The system automatically triggers the game start sequence, which begins with establishing the baseline price (p0) for Bitcoin against USD. This price anchoring process utilizes the HyperCore real-time price feed to capture the most current market price at the moment of game initiation.

The price anchoring mechanism implements several technical safeguards to ensure accuracy and prevent manipulation. The system captures multiple price samples over a brief window (typically 1-2 seconds) and uses statistical methods to identify and filter out potential outliers or erroneous data points. This approach provides resilience against temporary price spikes or data feed anomalies that could unfairly influence game outcomes.

The established baseline price (p0) serves as the reference point for all subsequent price movements and position calculations. The game interface displays this anchor price prominently to all participants, along with their assigned ball positions relative to this baseline. Long balls are positioned at predetermined percentage levels above p0 (typically ranging from +0.5% to +5.0%), while Short balls are positioned at corresponding levels below p0 (ranging from -0.5% to -5.0%).

**Real-Time Gameplay and Visual Feedback**

The 30-second gameplay period represents the core interactive experience, combining real-time price data with engaging visual presentations. The game interface displays a dynamic grid showing all 20 ball positions arranged vertically according to their price levels, with the current Bitcoin price indicated by a moving horizontal line or indicator.

Price updates occur at 100-millisecond intervals, providing smooth, responsive visual feedback that maintains participant engagement throughout the game duration. Each price update triggers several simultaneous processes: the current price indicator moves to reflect the new market price, the ball closest to the current price level is highlighted as the temporary winner, and statistical information such as price change percentage and direction is updated in real-time.

The visual design emphasizes clarity and immediate comprehension, using color coding and animation to convey game state information effectively. Long balls are displayed in green tones to represent bullish positions, while Short balls use red tones for bearish positions. The currently winning ball receives enhanced visual treatment, such as pulsing animations or increased brightness, to maintain participant attention and excitement.

The real-time feedback system also incorporates predictive elements that enhance the gaming experience. The interface displays trend indicators showing recent price momentum, volatility measures that indicate the likelihood of significant price movements, and countdown timers that build anticipation toward the final resolution. These elements combine to create an engaging, dynamic experience that holds participant attention throughout the entire 30-second duration.

**Game Resolution and Winner Determination**

The game resolution process represents the technical climax of the demonstration, showcasing the advanced capabilities of the Hyper Async Library through parallel order execution. At the conclusion of the 30-second gameplay period, the system captures the final Bitcoin price (p30) and initiates the order execution sequence that determines the ultimate winner.

The resolution mechanism simulates the execution of 20 limit orders corresponding to each ball position, with each order representing a hypothetical trade at the ball's designated price level. The Hyper Async Library enables all 20 orders to be processed simultaneously, demonstrating the performance advantages of asynchronous programming over traditional sequential approaches. This parallel execution typically completes within 1-2 seconds, compared to the 20+ seconds that would be required for sequential processing.

The winner determination algorithm identifies the ball position closest to the final price movement from the baseline. For Long balls, the winning position is determined by the smallest positive difference between the final price and the ball's target level, provided the price has moved upward from p0. For Short balls, the winning position corresponds to the smallest negative difference, provided the price has moved downward. In cases where the price movement direction doesn't favor either Long or Short positions exclusively, the algorithm selects the ball with the smallest absolute difference from the final price.

Edge case handling ensures fair and consistent outcomes regardless of market conditions. If the final price falls outside the predefined grid range, the system automatically adjusts the grid boundaries to encompass the actual price movement, ensuring that at least one ball position remains viable for execution. In the rare event of exact ties between multiple positions, the smart contract's randomization mechanism provides a fair tiebreaker selection.

**Reward Distribution and Game Conclusion**

The game concludes with the announcement of the winning participant and the distribution of rewards. The winning participant is identified through their wallet address associated with the winning ball position, and their victory is announced through both the digital interface and any physical presentation displays. The reward mechanism is designed to be memorable and engaging rather than financially significant, typically consisting of physical prizes such as branded merchandise or, as suggested in the original concept, cookies or other small tokens.

The reward distribution process serves multiple purposes beyond simple recognition. It provides a satisfying conclusion to the gaming experience, creates positive associations with the demonstrated technology, and offers networking opportunities as winners are often invited to discuss their experience or provide feedback. The physical nature of the rewards also creates photo opportunities and social media content that can extend the marketing impact of the demonstration.

The game conclusion includes a technical debrief component that highlights the key technological achievements demonstrated during the session. This debrief covers the successful execution of parallel order processing, the reliability of real-time price feeds, the fairness of blockchain-based randomization, and the seamless integration of multiple blockchain services. This educational component reinforces the technical messaging while the positive emotions from the gaming experience remain fresh in participants' minds.

**Scalability and Adaptation Mechanisms**

The game rules incorporate flexibility mechanisms that allow for adaptation to different audience sizes and technical constraints. While the standard configuration accommodates exactly 20 participants, the system can be configured for smaller groups by reducing the number of available ball positions or for larger audiences by implementing multiple concurrent game sessions.

For scenarios with fewer than 20 participants, the system can automatically generate simulated participants (bots) to fill remaining positions, ensuring that the full technical demonstration remains viable. These simulated participants follow the same assignment and execution processes as human players, maintaining the integrity of the asynchronous processing demonstration while accommodating variable audience sizes.

The adaptation mechanisms also include provisions for different time durations and price volatility scenarios. The 30-second standard duration can be adjusted based on presentation time constraints or audience engagement levels, while the price level spacing can be modified to account for different market volatility conditions or to emphasize specific technical aspects of the demonstration.



### 3.1 High-Level Components

The Price Prediction Game architecture consists of six primary components that work in concert to deliver a seamless, real-time gaming experience while demonstrating advanced asynchronous programming capabilities. Each component is designed with specific responsibilities and interfaces that enable modular development, testing, and deployment while maintaining system-wide performance and reliability standards.

**Frontend Web Application (React-based Game Interface)**

The frontend component serves as the primary user interface for game participants, implementing a responsive web application that functions seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. Built using React.js with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability, the frontend handles participant registration, real-time game state visualization, and user interaction management without requiring any cryptocurrency wallet connections.

The frontend architecture emphasizes simplicity and immediate accessibility, allowing participants to join games instantly by scanning a QR code and accessing the web interface. The application eliminates the complexity of wallet integration, cryptocurrency setup, or blockchain transaction signing, focusing instead on delivering an engaging gaming experience that demonstrates the underlying technical capabilities.

The simplified user interface collects minimal information from participants, typically just a display name or allowing anonymous participation with auto-generated identifiers. This streamlined approach maximizes participation rates during live demonstrations while maintaining the technical sophistication of the backend systems. The interface provides clear visual feedback about game status, participant count, and ball assignments without overwhelming users with technical details.

Real-time communication with the backend utilizes WebSocket connections to provide immediate updates on game state changes, price movements, and winner announcements. The interface displays dynamic visualizations of the game grid, current Bitcoin price movements, and participant positions using smooth animations and clear visual indicators that maintain engagement throughout the 30-second game duration.

**Python Backend Server (Flask with AsyncIO)**

The backend server represents the central orchestration component, managing game logic, participant coordination, and integration with external blockchain services. Implemented using Flask with AsyncIO extensions, the backend provides both HTTP REST endpoints for standard web interactions and WebSocket connections for real-time communication.

The Flask application structure incorporates several specialized modules that handle distinct aspects of game functionality. The game orchestration module manages the overall game lifecycle, from participant registration through final winner determination. The blockchain integration module handles interactions with HyperEVM smart contracts and manages wallet authentication and transaction processing. The price feed module maintains real-time connections to HyperCore price data and manages the distribution of price updates to connected clients.

Asynchronous programming patterns are implemented throughout the backend to ensure optimal performance during high-concurrency scenarios. The AsyncIO event loop manages concurrent operations such as price polling, order execution, and WebSocket communication without blocking the main application thread. This design enables the system to handle multiple simultaneous games and large numbers of concurrent participants while maintaining responsive performance.

Database integration utilizes SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite for development and testing, with straightforward migration paths to PostgreSQL or other production databases. The database schema captures essential game state information, participant records, and historical game data for analysis and debugging purposes. Database operations are optimized for the specific access patterns of the gaming application, with appropriate indexing and query optimization.

**HyperEVM Smart Contract Layer (Team-Managed)**

The smart contract component provides blockchain-based game logic that ensures fairness, transparency, and verifiability of game outcomes while being managed entirely through the development team's controlled wallets. Implemented in Solidity and deployed on the HyperEVM testnet, the smart contract handles game session management, ball assignment randomization, and winner verification processes without requiring individual participant wallet interactions.

The smart contract architecture is designed for demonstration purposes, with all blockchain interactions initiated by the backend server using pre-configured team wallets. This approach eliminates the complexity of individual wallet management while maintaining the technical demonstration of blockchain integration and smart contract functionality. The contract serves as the authoritative source for game state and provides verifiable randomness for ball assignments.

Game session management utilizes the smart contract to create unique game instances, each with its own set of 20 ball positions and associated metadata. The contract maintains mappings between session identifiers and game state, enabling multiple concurrent games while ensuring data isolation and integrity. Session creation and management are handled automatically by the backend server, with appropriate access controls ensuring that only authorized addresses can initiate new games.

Ball assignment randomization leverages on-chain entropy sources, including block hashes and timestamps, to generate cryptographically secure random numbers for position allocation. The randomization algorithm ensures fair distribution of long and short positions while providing transparency and verifiability that participants can independently audit. All assignment operations are recorded on-chain through event emissions that provide a permanent audit trail.

The contract interface is optimized for backend server integration, with functions designed for batch operations and efficient gas usage. Winner determination functions accept price data from authorized oracles (managed by the team) and execute the algorithmic logic for identifying winning positions. The contract emits detailed events for all significant state changes, enabling the backend server to maintain synchronized game state and provide real-time updates to participants.

**HyperCore Price Feed Integration**

The price feed component maintains real-time connections to HyperCore market data services, providing accurate and timely Bitcoin price information that drives game mechanics and visual updates. The integration utilizes WebSocket connections for low-latency data delivery and implements comprehensive error handling and reconnection logic to ensure reliable operation.

Price data processing includes several layers of validation and filtering to ensure accuracy and prevent manipulation. The system captures multiple price samples and applies statistical analysis to identify and filter outliers or erroneous data points. Moving averages and volatility calculations provide additional context for game mechanics and visual presentations.

The price feed architecture supports multiple data sources and automatic failover mechanisms to ensure continuous operation even in the event of individual service disruptions. Primary connections to HyperCore are supplemented by backup connections to alternative price providers, with automatic switching logic that maintains service continuity without user intervention.

Data distribution mechanisms ensure that price updates reach all connected clients with minimal latency. The system utilizes efficient WebSocket broadcasting techniques and implements client-side buffering to handle temporary network disruptions without losing critical price information. Rate limiting and bandwidth optimization ensure that the system can scale to support large numbers of concurrent participants without overwhelming network resources.

**Hyper Async Library Integration Layer**

The Hyper Async Library integration represents the core technical innovation of the project, enabling parallel execution of multiple blockchain operations that would otherwise require sequential processing. This component demonstrates the practical advantages of asynchronous programming in high-frequency trading scenarios and serves as the primary technical differentiator of the demonstration.

The integration layer provides a clean, pythonic interface for interacting with Hyperliquid trading APIs while abstracting the complexities of asynchronous operation management. The library handles connection pooling, request batching, and error recovery automatically, enabling application developers to focus on business logic rather than low-level networking concerns.

Order execution capabilities represent the most visible demonstration of the library's advantages. The system can process 20 simultaneous limit orders in parallel, completing the entire batch in approximately 1-2 seconds compared to the 20+ seconds required for sequential processing. This performance improvement is achieved through careful management of HTTP connections, request pipelining, and response processing optimization.

Error handling and recovery mechanisms ensure robust operation even under adverse network conditions. The library implements exponential backoff retry logic, automatic connection recovery, and graceful degradation strategies that maintain functionality when individual operations fail. Comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities provide visibility into system performance and enable rapid diagnosis of any issues that may arise.

**Real-Time Visualization and Animation Engine**

The visualization component creates engaging, dynamic presentations of game state information that maintain participant attention and clearly communicate complex technical concepts. Implemented using HTML5 Canvas and WebGL technologies, the visualization engine provides smooth animations and responsive interactions that enhance the overall user experience.

The animation system utilizes efficient rendering techniques to maintain 60fps performance even with complex visual effects and multiple simultaneous animations. Object pooling and sprite batching minimize memory allocation and garbage collection overhead, while shader-based effects provide visually appealing presentations without compromising performance.

Real-time data integration ensures that visual presentations accurately reflect current game state and price information. The visualization engine subscribes to WebSocket data streams and updates visual elements immediately as new information becomes available. Interpolation and smoothing algorithms provide visually pleasing transitions between data points while maintaining accuracy and responsiveness.

The component architecture supports multiple presentation modes and customization options, enabling adaptation to different screen sizes, audience configurations, and presentation requirements. Responsive design principles ensure optimal presentation quality across desktop displays, mobile devices, and large presentation screens commonly used in hackathon and conference environments.


### 3.3 Integration Flow

The integration flow orchestrates the complex interactions between multiple blockchain services, real-time data feeds, and user interfaces to deliver a seamless gaming experience. The flow is designed to handle concurrent operations efficiently while maintaining data consistency and providing responsive user feedback throughout the entire game lifecycle.

**Phase 1: Game Initialization and Participant Registration**

The integration flow begins with the presentation of a QR code that encodes the game session URL and necessary connection parameters. The QR code generation process incorporates session-specific identifiers and security tokens that prevent unauthorized access and ensure that participants connect to the correct game instance.

When participants scan the QR code, their mobile devices automatically open the web-based game interface, which provides immediate access without requiring wallet connections or cryptocurrency setup. The interface presents a simple registration form where participants can optionally enter a display name or proceed anonymously with an auto-generated identifier.

Upon accessing the interface, the frontend application automatically sends a registration request to the Python backend server. This request includes the participant's chosen display name (or generated identifier), session identifiers, device information, and connection timestamps. The backend server validates the registration request, checks for duplicate participants based on device fingerprinting and session management, and assigns the participant to an available game slot.

The backend server manages all blockchain interactions through pre-configured team wallets, eliminating the need for individual participant wallet management. When a new participant registers, the server initiates a transaction with the HyperEVM smart contract using the team's managed wallet to record the participant registration and trigger the ball assignment process.

The smart contract processes the registration by generating a cryptographically secure random number using block hash and timestamp data, then uses this randomness to assign one of the available ball positions to the participant. The assignment process ensures fair distribution by maintaining an internal mapping of available positions and selecting randomly from the remaining options. All blockchain interactions are abstracted away from participants, who simply see their assigned ball position appear in the game interface.

Once the ball assignment is complete, the smart contract emits a registration event that includes the participant's session identifier, assigned ball identifier, and position type (long or short). The Python backend server monitors these events through WebSocket connections to the blockchain and immediately updates its internal game state to reflect the new participant. The backend then broadcasts the updated participant list to all connected clients through WebSocket connections, enabling real-time updates of the participant interface without requiring any blockchain knowledge from users.

**Phase 2: Real-Time Price Monitoring and Game State Management**

When the participant count reaches the configured threshold (typically 20 players), the backend server automatically initiates the game start sequence. This process begins with establishing the baseline Bitcoin price (p0) through a query to the HyperCore price feed API. The price establishment process captures multiple samples over a brief window to ensure accuracy and filters out any anomalous data points that could unfairly influence game outcomes.

The established baseline price is immediately broadcast to all connected participants through WebSocket connections, along with the calculated position levels for each ball. Long balls are positioned at predetermined percentage levels above p0, while short balls are positioned at corresponding levels below p0. The frontend applications receive this information and update their visual displays to show the complete game grid with all participant positions clearly marked.

The real-time monitoring phase utilizes the Hyper Async Library to establish concurrent connections to multiple HyperCore price feed endpoints. This redundant approach ensures continuous price data availability even if individual endpoints experience temporary disruptions. The async library manages connection pooling and automatic failover between endpoints, maintaining sub-100ms latency for price updates throughout the game duration.

Price updates are processed through a sophisticated filtering and validation pipeline that ensures data quality and prevents manipulation. Each incoming price sample is compared against recent historical data to identify potential outliers or erroneous values. Statistical analysis techniques, including moving averages and volatility calculations, provide additional validation layers that maintain data integrity.

Validated price updates trigger immediate distribution to all connected clients through optimized WebSocket broadcasting. The backend server maintains separate WebSocket connections for each participant and uses efficient message serialization to minimize bandwidth usage and latency. Client-side applications receive price updates and immediately update their visual displays, creating smooth, responsive animations that maintain participant engagement.

**Phase 3: Asynchronous Order Execution and Winner Determination**

The game resolution phase represents the technical climax of the demonstration, showcasing the advanced capabilities of the Hyper Async Library through parallel order execution managed entirely by the team's controlled wallets. At the conclusion of the 30-second gameplay period, the backend server captures the final Bitcoin price (p30) and initiates the order execution sequence that demonstrates the performance advantages of asynchronous processing.

The order execution process creates 20 simulated limit orders corresponding to each ball position, with order parameters calculated based on the position's target price level and the final market price. These orders are executed using the team's pre-funded Hyperliquid accounts, eliminating the need for individual participant wallet management while maintaining the technical demonstration of parallel processing capabilities.

The Hyper Async Library enables all 20 orders to be submitted simultaneously to the Hyperliquid order book through the team's managed accounts, demonstrating the performance advantages of asynchronous programming over traditional sequential approaches. This parallel execution typically completes within 1-2 seconds, compared to the 20+ seconds that would be required for sequential processing using synchronous methods.

The async library manages the complex coordination required for parallel order execution, including connection pooling, request batching, and response aggregation across multiple team-controlled accounts. Each order submission includes appropriate error handling and retry logic to ensure reliable execution even under adverse network conditions. The library's connection management ensures optimal utilization of available network resources while respecting API rate limits and other service constraints.

Order execution results are collected and analyzed to determine the winning position based on predefined algorithms that simulate real trading outcomes. The winner determination logic identifies the ball position that would have achieved the best execution price relative to the final market price movement, with all actual trading risk managed through the team's controlled accounts rather than exposing individual participants to financial risk.

The winner determination process includes comprehensive edge case handling to ensure fair outcomes regardless of market conditions. If the final price falls outside the predefined grid range, the algorithm automatically adjusts position calculations to maintain competitive balance. In cases of exact ties between multiple positions, the system utilizes the smart contract's randomization mechanism to provide a fair tiebreaker selection, with all blockchain interactions managed through team wallets.

**Phase 4: Result Verification and Reward Distribution**

The final phase of the integration flow focuses on result verification and participant notification, with all blockchain interactions managed through the team's controlled wallets. The backend server submits the calculated winner information to the HyperEVM smart contract for verification and permanent recording, using the team's authorized wallet to ensure transaction reliability and eliminate participant complexity.

Upon successful verification, the smart contract emits a winner announcement event that includes the winning participant's session identifier, ball identifier, and relevant game statistics. The Python backend server monitors these events and immediately updates its internal records to reflect the final game outcome. This blockchain-based verification provides transparency and auditability while maintaining the simplified user experience that requires no cryptocurrency knowledge from participants.

Winner notification utilizes multiple communication channels to ensure that the winning participant receives immediate notification of their victory. The primary notification mechanism uses WebSocket connections to deliver real-time updates to the participant's connected device, displaying congratulatory messages and winner information directly in the game interface. The system maintains participant anonymity while providing clear identification of the winning position and associated display name.

The reward distribution process is designed for immediate fulfillment during live demonstrations, typically consisting of physical prizes such as branded merchandise, food items, or other tangible rewards that can be distributed on-site. The system provides organizers with the necessary winner identification information, including display names and seating locations when available, to facilitate efficient prize distribution without requiring any cryptocurrency transactions or wallet interactions from participants.

The simplified reward mechanism eliminates the complexity of on-chain token distribution or cryptocurrency transfers while maintaining the engaging competitive element that drives participant interest. This approach ensures that the demonstration remains focused on the technical capabilities of the asynchronous library and blockchain integration rather than the mechanics of cryptocurrency reward distribution.

**Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms**

Throughout all phases of the integration flow, comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms ensure robust operation even under adverse conditions. Network connectivity issues are addressed through automatic retry logic, connection pooling, and graceful degradation strategies that maintain core functionality when individual services experience disruptions.

Blockchain interaction errors, such as transaction failures or network congestion, are handled through exponential backoff retry mechanisms and alternative execution paths. The system maintains fallback options for critical operations, ensuring that game progression can continue even if specific blockchain interactions encounter temporary difficulties.

Real-time data feed disruptions are mitigated through redundant data sources and automatic failover mechanisms. The system continuously monitors data feed quality and automatically switches to backup sources when primary feeds become unreliable. Client-side buffering and interpolation techniques provide smooth user experiences even during brief data interruptions.

User interface errors and connectivity issues are addressed through comprehensive client-side error handling and user feedback mechanisms. The frontend applications provide clear error messages and recovery instructions when problems occur, while automatic reconnection logic attempts to restore functionality without requiring manual user intervention. Progressive enhancement techniques ensure that core functionality remains available even when advanced features encounter difficulties.

p0 - 4.0%      | S8 (Short)    | Bearish
p0 - 5.0%      | S9 (Short)    | Bearish
```

**Visual Design Elements:**

- **Color Coding:** Long positions (B0-B9) displayed in green tones, Short positions (S0-S9) in red tones
- **Current Price Indicator:** Horizontal line or animated marker showing real-time BTC price
- **Winning Position Highlight:** Enhanced visual treatment (pulsing, brightness) for currently winning ball
- **Price Movement Animation:** Smooth transitions as price indicator moves up/down the grid
- **Participant Identification:** Display names or anonymous identifiers associated with each ball position

**Dynamic Behavior:**

The grid responds to real-time price updates with smooth animations that maintain visual continuity while clearly indicating changing game conditions. As the current price moves through different levels, the corresponding ball positions receive visual emphasis, creating an engaging spectacle that holds audience attention throughout the 30-second game duration.

**Adaptive Grid Scaling:**

The system includes automatic grid adjustment mechanisms to handle edge cases where the final price falls outside the predefined range. If price movements exceed the initial grid boundaries, the system dynamically recalculates position levels to ensure that at least one ball remains in a winning position, maintaining game integrity regardless of market volatility.

## 6. Next Steps & Approvals

The successful implementation of the Price Prediction Game requires coordinated execution across multiple technical domains, with careful attention to both the demonstration requirements and the underlying technical objectives. The following section outlines the immediate actions required to initiate development, key decision points that require stakeholder approval, and the ongoing management processes necessary to ensure project success.

**Immediate Development Initiation Actions**

The project initiation phase requires several critical decisions and resource allocations that will determine the overall success of the demonstration. The development team must be assembled with appropriate expertise in Python backend development, React frontend development, blockchain smart contract programming, and real-time systems architecture. Each team member should have demonstrated experience with the specific technologies outlined in the technical architecture, particularly Flask with AsyncIO, Solidity smart contract development, and WebSocket-based real-time communication systems.

Resource allocation decisions must address both development infrastructure and demonstration environment requirements. The development infrastructure should include appropriate cloud computing resources for testing and staging environments, access to HyperEVM testnet for smart contract deployment and testing, and HyperCore API credentials for price feed integration. The demonstration environment requires consideration of presentation venue requirements, network connectivity specifications, and backup systems to ensure reliable operation during live presentations.

The Hyper Async Library integration represents a critical dependency that requires early validation and testing. The development team must have access to the library documentation, example implementations, and direct communication channels with the library development team for technical support and troubleshooting. Early integration testing should validate the library's performance characteristics and confirm that the expected asynchronous processing advantages can be achieved in the demonstration environment.

**Stakeholder Approval Requirements**

Several key aspects of the project require explicit stakeholder approval before development can proceed effectively. The technical architecture decisions, particularly the choice to use team-managed wallets rather than individual participant wallets, represent a significant simplification that affects both the user experience and the technical demonstration value. Stakeholders must confirm that this approach aligns with the overall demonstration objectives and marketing messaging.

The scope and complexity of the demonstration must be validated against available development resources and timeline constraints. The 10-14 day development timeline is aggressive and requires dedicated team focus with minimal scope changes during the development period. Stakeholders should approve the feature set and confirm that additional requirements will not be introduced during the development phase without corresponding timeline adjustments.

Budget approval is required for cloud infrastructure costs, third-party service integrations, and any premium features or services required for the demonstration. While the core development utilizes open-source technologies, production deployment and high-availability requirements may necessitate paid services for monitoring, content delivery, and backup systems.

**Risk Management and Contingency Planning**

The project timeline and technical complexity create several risk factors that require proactive management and contingency planning. Network connectivity represents the primary operational risk, as the demonstration relies on real-time price feeds and blockchain interactions that could be affected by venue network limitations or service provider outages. Contingency plans should include offline demonstration modes, backup data sources, and alternative presentation formats that maintain the core technical messaging even under adverse conditions.

The integration complexity between multiple blockchain services creates technical risks that could affect system reliability during demonstrations. Each integration point should have comprehensive error handling, automatic retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation strategies that maintain core functionality even when individual services experience disruptions. The development process should include extensive integration testing and load testing to identify and resolve potential failure points before live demonstrations.

Team availability and expertise represent resource risks that could affect project timeline and quality. The specialized nature of the technical requirements means that team member unavailability could significantly impact development progress. Cross-training and documentation strategies should ensure that critical knowledge is shared across multiple team members, and backup resources should be identified for key technical roles.

**Quality Assurance and Testing Strategy**

The demonstration nature of the project requires exceptional reliability and performance, as technical failures during live presentations could significantly impact the marketing and educational objectives. The quality assurance strategy must include comprehensive automated testing, manual testing scenarios that simulate actual demonstration conditions, and stress testing that validates system performance under maximum load conditions.

User experience testing should focus on the specific constraints of hackathon and conference environments, including varying network conditions, diverse mobile devices, and time-pressured participation scenarios. The testing process should validate that participants can successfully join games within the target timeframes and that the visual presentations remain clear and engaging across different screen sizes and viewing conditions.

Performance benchmarking represents a critical component of the quality assurance process, as the primary technical objective is demonstrating the performance advantages of asynchronous processing. The benchmarking process should include side-by-side comparisons between synchronous and asynchronous approaches, with clear metrics that can be presented to technical audiences. The benchmarks should be reproducible and documented to support the technical claims made during demonstrations.

**Ongoing Project Management and Communication**

The rapid development timeline requires efficient project management processes that minimize overhead while maintaining clear communication and progress tracking. Daily standup meetings should focus on immediate blockers and integration dependencies, with weekly progress reviews that assess overall project health and timeline adherence. The project management approach should emphasize early identification of risks and proactive problem-solving rather than reactive issue resolution.

Communication with external dependencies, particularly the Hyper Async Library development team and blockchain service providers, requires established channels and response time expectations. Technical questions and integration issues should be escalated quickly to avoid development delays, and backup communication methods should be established for critical support scenarios.

Documentation and knowledge management processes should capture technical decisions, integration details, and troubleshooting procedures in real-time during development. This documentation serves both immediate development needs and long-term maintenance requirements, and should be structured to support rapid onboarding of additional team members if required.

**Success Metrics and Evaluation Criteria**

The project success should be evaluated against both technical performance metrics and demonstration effectiveness criteria. Technical metrics include system response times, concurrent user capacity, order execution performance, and system reliability during demonstration scenarios. These metrics should be clearly defined, measurable, and aligned with the technical claims that the demonstration is intended to support.

Demonstration effectiveness criteria focus on audience engagement, technical message clarity, and overall presentation impact. These qualitative measures require feedback collection from demonstration audiences and should include assessments of technical comprehension, engagement levels, and perceived value of the demonstrated capabilities.

The evaluation process should include post-demonstration analysis that captures lessons learned, identifies improvement opportunities, and documents best practices for future similar projects. This analysis should cover both technical aspects and presentation effectiveness, providing valuable insights for ongoing development of demonstration and educational materials.

**Long-term Maintenance and Evolution**

While the immediate focus is on delivering a functional demonstration system, consideration should be given to the long-term evolution and maintenance requirements of the project. The codebase and architecture should be designed to support ongoing updates, feature additions, and adaptation to different demonstration contexts. The documentation and deployment procedures should enable ongoing maintenance by team members who were not involved in the initial development.

The demonstration system may serve as a foundation for additional educational and marketing initiatives, requiring extensibility and adaptability in the core architecture. Future enhancements might include support for different cryptocurrency pairs, alternative game mechanics, or integration with additional blockchain services. The initial implementation should consider these potential extensions without over-engineering the current requirements.

The project represents an investment in both immediate demonstration capabilities and longer-term technical expertise within the organization. The knowledge and experience gained during development should be captured and shared to support future blockchain integration projects and asynchronous programming initiatives. The project should contribute to the organization's overall technical capabilities and serve as a reference implementation for similar future projects.
